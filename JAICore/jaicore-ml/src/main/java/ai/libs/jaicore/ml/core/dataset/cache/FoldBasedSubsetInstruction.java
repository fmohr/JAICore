/**
 * Instruction to track a fold-based subset computation for a {@link ReproducibleInstances} object.
 * The original dataset is split into folds using the specified fold technique, e.g., 10-fold cross validation or a simple stratified split.
 * Then, a subset of the created folds is joined as to determine the desired subset of the original set.
 *
 * For example, to obtain the training data in a 5-fold cross validation if the test data corresponds to the 3rd fold, the foldTechnique is "<method for cross validation>(5, <seed>)", and the outIndices are "0,1,3,4"
