# AILibs
AILibs is a collection of Java libraries related to automated decision making. It currently consists of two building blocks. It is also home of the current version of the AutoML-tool [ML-Plan](https://github.com/starlibs/AILibs/tree/master/softwareconfiguration/mlplan).

* **JAICore** (Java AI Core) is a collection of projects with basic general purpose AI algorithms mainly in the area of logic reasoning, heuristic search, and machine learning
* **softwareconfiguration** is a collection of projects related to automatically configuring software systems. Here we also maintain the code for our AutoML flagship **[ML-Plan](https://github.com/starlibs/AILibs/tree/master/softwareconfiguration/mlplan)**
